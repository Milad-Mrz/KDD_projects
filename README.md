1- **Introduction:** 

This project aims to analyze the patterns and trends in hourly bike-sharing usage. With over 500 bike-sharing programs worldwide and over 500,000 bicycles, bike-sharing systems have become a popular and important mode of transportation, contributing significantly to traffic, environmental, and health-related issues.

The data generated by these systems provides a wealth of information about the travel patterns, user behavior, and preferences, making them a valuable resource for research. Unlike other transport services, bike-sharing systems explicitly record the duration of travel, departure and arrival positions, providing a virtual sensor network that can be used to sense mobility in the city. Through SocialBikeMine, we aim to use advanced data mining techniques to uncover meaningful insights into the usage patterns of bike-sharing systems, and their impact on the city's mobility and sustainability.
